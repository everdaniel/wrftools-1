CURRENTLY ONLY SUPPORTS WRF-ARW CORE. WORK IS BEING DONE TO IMPLEMENT WRF-NMM.
EXAMPLE IPYTHON NOTEBOOK UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

Requires: numpy

This library is a compilation of functions designed for the purposes of post processing output from the WRF model. 
wrftools.variables contains the functions for generating various data, and wrftools.interp contains the function for vertically interpolating grids. 

Below is a brief description of the functions available. See the documentation for information on how to use them.

utils:
    Contains utility functions, such as saving and copying netCDF attributes and unit conversions.
    - attributes: Various netCDF and data attributes, such as unstaggering WRF grids and copying metadata
    - conversions: Various unit conversions for distance, temperature, speed, and pressure

interp:
    Contains functions used to interpolate data to specific vertical levels.
    - pres: interpolate data to pressure levels
    - pv: interpolate data to pv levels

variables:
    Contains functions needed to calculate variables from the standard WRF output.
    - thermo: contains thermodynamic computations, such as temperature and moisture variables.
    - winds: contains kinematic computations, such as vorticity and potential vorticity.
    - vertical: contains computations to calculate pressure and height.
future work:
    Add routines for parcel indices (CAPE, CINH, LCL, LFC, EL)
    Add routines for shear indices (bulk shear, effective bulk shear, effective SRH, 0-1km SRH, 0-3km SRH, Storm Motion Vector)
    Port routines to WRF-NMM
